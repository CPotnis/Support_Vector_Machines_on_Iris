# Support Vector Machines on Iris Data Set

Analyzing the famous iris data set and predicting the "species" using Support Vector Machines.

## Installation

This project requires **Python 2.7 or 3+** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

 ```bash
jupyter notebook Support_Vector_Machines_Iris_Data.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.



## Data

- The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
